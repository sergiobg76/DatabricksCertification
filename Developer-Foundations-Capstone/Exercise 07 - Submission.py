# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Congrats on getting to the end of the capstone! 
# MAGIC 2. With each execution of each reality check, our tracking system records your progress.
# MAGIC 3. This does not ensure that you have passed; why?
# MAGIC   * Notebooks executed out of order alter the datasets on which subsequent exercises depend on.
# MAGIC   * Within any given exercise, the out-of-order-execution of cells presents a similar problem. For example, it is possible to report that Reality-Check-3 passed and **then** Reality-Check-1 passed.
# MAGIC   * In both cases, our systems recorded the out-of-order-execution of the exercises and the individual cells (namely the Reality Checks), which is processed as a failed execution.
# MAGIC 4. For the capstone project to be correctly evaluated, you must:
# MAGIC   * Run each exercise in order, from top to bottom.
# MAGIC   * Start with Exercise #1 and proceed through Exercise #6.
# MAGIC   * Within each exercise, select **Clear**|**Clear State & Results** and then **Run All**
# MAGIC   * If the execution of any exercise fails and you have to make corrections, please make sure to re-run the entire exercise and all subsequent exercises.
# MAGIC 5. Periodically, our backend system scans for capstone projects that have been completed correctly - namely that all Reality Checks pass and that they were executed in the correct order.
# MAGIC 6. A badge will be emailed to the account on file once a successfully executed capstone project has been identified.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Note: succesfully identifying a passing capstone project and the subsequent delivery of your badge can take up to two weeks.
